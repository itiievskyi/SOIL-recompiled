# SOIL-recompiled

SOIL is a tiny C library used primarily for uploading textures into OpenGL.
You can find the source code of SOIL at the [official page](https://www.lonesock.net/soil.html).

The library can be used "as is" or compiled right on your computer. 
Unfortunately the static library downloaded for the mentioned page didn't work for me so I compiled it on my iMac 2017 with macos High Sierra on board.

This library was successfully tested with OpenGL while making a small 2D game.

### How to use:
Just clone or dowload the library as well as header file and use it while compiling your program.

### Enjoy!
